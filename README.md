# Live 4 Life

## Overview

The spatial performance tool *Live 4 Life*, which is in constant development under the Mac platform, aims to simplify the creation and control in real time of mass of spatialised sound objects on various kinds of loudspeaker configurations (particularly stereo and octophonic setups, as well as domes of 16, 24 or 32 loudspeakers...).

## Warning

Although the code is available here, the interface and the setup are relatively complex, as it is not meant to be a simple graphic user interface (GUI) for a casual, untrained user of SuperCollider, but focused to allow the creation of a lot of combinations tailored to my creative dreams.
It is designed for a specific screen size (1920×1200) and an AZERTY keyboard.

## Requirements

* [SuperCollider 3.12.1](https://supercollider.github.io/download)

* a lot of Quarks

## Installation

### Plarform support

*Live 4 Life* was only tested with macOS 10.14.6 Mojave. 
It will soon be optimized for MacOS M1 16".
The reason why I do not switch to Linux is that I often used Dante as a virtual sound card to send multiple channels in some concert halls. And Dante is not available for linux.
It might work for Linux and Windows platforms after solving some issues. 
I know that you would have to change on Linux.
I cannot help on Linux and Windows platforms since I currently do not have a simple access to both of them.

I wish it would be used in the minds of *Free Party*. *Free* unfortunately does not mean free in this commercial world, but invites to contribute to the costs and labor according to one's ability to give. I therefore do not want this tool to be used, by any means, for profit or personal profit.

Moreover, I would **not** like that this tool to be used by [Société des Arts Technologiques](https://sat.qc.ca) without my consent, since this organization never helped me in diffusing my spatial creation and research despite my proposals. If these wishes are not respected, my soul will damn you for eternity.

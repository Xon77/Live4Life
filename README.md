## Overview

The spatial performance tool *Live 4 Life*, which is in constant development under the Mac platform, aims to simplify the creation and control in real time of mass of spatialised sound objects on various kinds of loudspeaker configurations (particularly stereo, quadriphonic or octophonic setups, as well as domes of 16, 24 or 32 loudspeakers...). 

I have been developing in SuperCollider since 2011, to play the place and the music at the same time.

## Warning

Although the code is available here, the interface and the setup are relatively complex, as this tool is not meant to be a simple graphic user interface (GUI) for a casual, untrained user of SuperCollider, but focused to allow the creation of a lot of combinations tailored to my creative dreams.
It is designed for a specific screen size (1920×1200) and an AZERTY keyboard.

## Requirements

* [SuperCollider 3.12.1](https://supercollider.github.io/download)

* a lot of Quarks

  - Twister 

## Installation

### Plarform support

*Live 4 Life* was only tested with macOS 10.14.6 Mojave on a MacBook Pro 15". 
It will soon be optimized for MacOS M1 16".

The reason why I do not switch from Mac to Linux is that I often used [Dante](https://www.audinate.com/products) to send multiple channels via ethernet in some concert halls. Since Dante virtual sound cards are not available for linux, you need to buy specific expensive sound cards to use Dante.

It might work for Linux and Windows platforms after solving some issues. 
I know that you would have to change on Linux.
I cannot help on Linux and Windows platforms since I currently do not have a simple access to both of them.

I wish it would be used in the spirit of *Free Party*. Unfortunately, *Free* does not mean free in this commercial world, but invites to contribute to the costs and labor according to one's ability to give. I therefore do not want this tool to be used, by any means, for personal profit.

Moreover, I would **not** like that this tool to be used by [Société des Arts Technologiques](https://sat.qc.ca) without my consent, since this organization never helped me in diffusing my spatial creation and research despite my proposals.
